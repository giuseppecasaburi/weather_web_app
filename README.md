# CLUB MAGELLANO - WEATHER WEB APP 
## Objective  
The objective of this project is to create an interactive and responsive front-end Weather 
Dashboard application.  
The application will provide users with a comprehensive forecast for Lodi, Italy.  
You can use any technology you prefer. 

**Requirements** 
1) The Weather Dashboard should have two pages: the dashboard and settings. Users 
should be able to navigate between the two pages. The settings page can be empty 
except for the link back to the dashboard. 
2) Implement Responsive Web Design: The application should display correctly on both 
mobile and desktop devices.  
3) Implement at least one interactive element with the help of JavaScript. 
4) Incorporate APIs for dynamic data.  
5) Host the website. 

**Nice To Have**
In a business environment where multiple people collaborate on the same project, it is 
important to maintain clear, easily maintainable, and easily scalable code. 
Please remember to comment your code and optimize what you write.
